			<p class = "lead"> A risk map spatially representing areas in the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Coast of Maryland that pose a risk to Loggerhead Sea turtles in the summer of 2015. The map takes into consideration oceanic variables such as sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a, and historical stranding/mortality data from 1991 to 2015. </p>
			<p class = "lead">The Pearsonâ€™s r correlation values were used as a guide to create a risk map relative to stranding in 2015. The averaged monthly datasets of SST and chlorophyll-a for the peak months from April to June were converted and reclassified into raster format. In addition, by utilizing the point density tool, the magnitude per unit area of sea turtle stranding occurrences were calculated into a density raster. Using the weighted overlay method, these raster files were then reclassified into 5 levels according to risk and overlaid using a common measurement scale, weighted according to importance. The weights were based upon the correlation values, utilizing 50% as stranding density, 40% as sea surface temperature, and 10% as chlorophyll-a.  Furthermore, in order to create a continuous risk map, the weighted raster layer was first converted into point vector format to undergo an inverse distance weighted (IDW) technique, which determines cell values using linearly weighted combination of a set of sample points.</p>

				<p class = "lead"> Mangrove forests hold ecological importance in providing ecosystem services such as filtration of water pollution, acting as buffers against strong waves, preventing soil erosion, and most importantly providing fish nurseries. However, Mangrove forests in many tropical regions including the Philippines have been threatened with destruction due to increased anthropogenic activities and conversion of forests into aquaculture. This study aims to analyze the mangrove forests located in Sibuguey Bay to document and compare the disturbance and changes between 1995 and 2002. The Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 5 TM images were atmospherically corrected, and masked for clouds to determine the Disturbance Index (DI). After visualizing the disturbed and undisturbed mangrove forests, regions of interests (ROI) were taken to undergo the Maximum Likelihood Classification method to classify land cover change.</p>

				<p class = "lead">
				The top right image shows the final classification image. The unchanged mangrove forests, seen as a mossy green area along the coastal region is about 4.13% of the subsetted area and equates to about 0.0302 hectares. Unfortunately, the changed land cover did not stay within the mangrove regions and are seen periodically within non-mangrove classified areas. Nevertheless the sea green class is 2.38% of the total subsetted area and 0.01469 hectares. Of course, this is an overestimate when determining solely the mangrove disturbed areas. Likewise the burgundy class that reflect the highly disturbed areas from 1995 to 2002 is not reflective solely on mangrove disturbance and often reflect roads and urbanized areas. It is also seen to reflect cloud cover (though clouds were already masked), likely to be the caused by 14 thin layers of clouds that were not taken out from the image. The burgundy, high disturbed areas were 1.96% of the total subsetted areas and 0.01083 hectares. Therefore, the total overestimated disturbed area is about 0.02552 hectares.

			<p class = "lead"> With the rise of urbanization in many developing nations, there needs to be better monitoring on how to sustainably urbanize when dealing with high population growth rates, while maintaining adequate living standards. One of the many issues with urbanization include the urban heat island effect, predominantly seen where large concentrated urban bodies with impervious surfaces retain large amounts of heat compared to its surrounding rural environment.The combination between rapid urban growth coupled with frequently intensifying heat waves due to global warming can significantly impact human health in these regions and can result in a positive feedback giving rise to even higher temperatures. There have already been cases in cities such as Shanghai, China where heat induced mortality is seen to increase directly due to the urban heat effect (Tan et al. 2010). <br><br>

			This project monitors heat related risks in Jakarta, Indonesia from 1999 to 2015 by looking at land surface temperature and land cover classification, potentially forecasting future risk by using climatic models. The project will also utilize any demographic data from the regions census bureau to monitor heat-related mortality in the region.</p>

          The nations of the Caribbean sea were inundated by unprecedented quantities of Sargassum, a free-floating brown macro-alga, that washed ashore. The project
          aims to monitor and model Sargassum growth and spatial distribution within this region from years 2003 until 2015 by utilizing NASA Earth
          observations. Daily MODIS Terra imagery were obtained, as well as, oceanic variables: sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a.
          The team derived the Floating Algal Index (FAI) using Terra MODIS data, and compared the FAI to various oceanic variables to determine the ideal
           pelagic environment for Sargassum growth. The project also examined the annual spread of Sargassum throughout the region by using TerrSet's
           Earth Trends Modeler. As part of the international effort to better understand the life cycle of Sargassum in the Caribbean, the results of
           this project will help local economies thrive and promote sustainable management practices.
