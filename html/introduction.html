			<em><h3> Vector-Borne Illness</h3></em>
			<p><h3>There is a growing need in the world today to accurately assess how the climate and land cover change affect health in regions where vector-borne diseases are prevalent.
        Fortunately, earth observation data is invaluable towards combatting human health issues by targeting vulnerable regions prone to disease outbreaks, equipping decision makers to
        implement efficient management and mitigation efforts. For example, a study used remote sensing technology to reveal a correlation between land cover changes in the Mangalore,
        India region with increased incidence of malaria outbreaks. During the year 2003 to 2005 there was rapid urbanization and deforestation that took place in the region, at the same time,
        cases of malaria increased to about five-fold (Mohan & Naumova 2011). By using remote sensing technology to detect dynamic relationship between human activity and the environment,
        regional populations can protect and prevent against disease outbreaks. </h3></p>
			<br>
			<em><h3>Urbanization</h3></em>
			<p><h3>
        With the rise of urbanization in many developing nations, there needs to be better monitoring on how to sustainably urbanize when dealing with high population growth rates,
        while maintaining adequate living standards. One of the many issues with urbanization include the urban heat island effect, predominantly seen where large concentrated urban bodies
        with impervious surfaces retain large amounts of heat compared to its surrounding rural environment. The combination between rapid urban growth coupled with frequently intensifying
        heat waves due to global warming can significantly impact human health in these regions and can result in a positive feedback giving rise to even higher temperatures. There have already
        been cases in cities such as Shanghai, China where heat induced mortality is seen to increase directly due to the urban heat effect (Tan et al. 2010).

				<p><h3>Monitoring deforestation esspecially in the tropical regions of the world like the Amazon rainforest has been crucial this past decade.
          To understand human impact at a large-scale and determine/quantify things such as carbon sequesteration and release it is imperative to classify land cover
          (detecting disturbance and changes, NDVI, etc.) </h3></p>

				<p><h3>NASA remote-sensing technology has become the backbone of worldwide efforts to quickly, routinely, and reliably assess trends in tropical deforestation.
          Since the 1970s, the Landsat series of satellites has provided high-resolution imagery (resolution means “level of detail”) of changes in tropical forests over time.
          The most comprehensive use of Landsat data to map tropical deforestation has been NASA’s Landsat Pathfinder Humid Tropical Deforestation Project, a collaborative effort
          among scientists from the University of Maryland, the University of New Hampshire, and NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. The project yielded deforestation maps for the
          Amazon Basin, Central Africa, and Southeast Asia for three periods in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.

				<p><h3>
         Monitoring natural disasters such as landslides, wildfires, and volcanoe eruptions can be done using real-time data coupled with powerful image processing and analysis softwares.
         These tools can be crucial for government agencies or organizations to monitor, detect, and react to natural disasters in the fastest way possible in order to limit human mortality.

				<p><h3>For example, the image on the right depicts a volcanic eruption on the Indonesian island of Lambok in October 2015. The imagery is from MODIS sensor on NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites.
           It is evident which direction the ash's are drifing towards, information such as this can also be useful in disaster relief efforts. </h3></p>

          This is a broader field of expertise and can deal with a wider range of possibilities depending on the species, or environment you are trying to protect.
          Topics such as resource management can also fall into this category because for example, water quality, and managing resources from National/State Parks
          can all be considered acts of conservation. The main thing one thinks of when talking about environmental conservation are protecting and management of endangered species and habitats from anthropogenic activities
